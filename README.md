# Math for Machine Learning Linear Algebra
**Problem Statement**: FinMark Corporation has a wealth of data collected from various sources, including customer transactions, social media interactions, and demographic information. However, the company struggles to derive meaningful insights due to data overload and inconsistencies. The current customer segmentation strategies are outdated, and there is a lack of clarity on market trends and customer behaviors.

**Project Deliverables**: Over the next 12 weeks, the company wants you to develop a machine learning solution to address these challenges. The composition of the machine learning solution is as follows:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** - explores the main characteristics of the collected data, identifies key patterns, and detects anomalies in the FinMark Corporation datasets.

2. **Data Visualization** -  discovers relationships between variables and identifies patterns and trends in the FinMark Corporation datasets.

3. **Presentation of Machine Learning Solution Project** - a presentation of your development process and findings.
